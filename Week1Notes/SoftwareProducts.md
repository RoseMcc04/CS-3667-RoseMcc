## Project-Based Software Engineering

- Starting point (Development): software requirements, created by the client, describing needed functionality 
    - Software Developed internally or by external software company (contractor/consultants) who design and implement a system that delivers functionality to meet the requirements
    - Custom software usually has a long lifetime, must be supported over that lifetime
    - Lifetime could be 10 years or more
    - Many systems (legacy systems) are decades old 
- Starting point (Business): a business opportunity, identified by individuals or a company
    - They develop a software product to take advantage of this opportunity and sell this to customers
    - The company who identified the opportunity design and implement a set of software features that realize the opportunity and that will be useful to customers
    - Who is responsible for deciding on the development timescale, what features to include, and when the product should change?
    - The software development company (not an external client!)
    - Rapid delivery of software products is essential to capture the market for that type of product
