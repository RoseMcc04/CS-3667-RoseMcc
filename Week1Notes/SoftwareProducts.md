## What is a Software Product?

- Software products are generic software systems that provide functionality that is useful to a range of customers. 

## Software Products

- Significant differences of scale: large-scale business systems, personal multi-platform products, mobile apps, and games
- Software product engineering methods and techniques have evolved from software engineering techniques that support one-off, custom software systems
- These custom software systems are developed in dedicated software projects - still important for large businesses, government, and public bodies

- Noted Examples:
    - Yelp
    - Google Maps

- Given Examples:
    - Microsoft Excel
    - WhatsApp

## Project-Based Software Engineering

- Starting point (Development): software requirements, created by the client, describing needed functionality 
    - Software Developed internally or by external software company (contractor/consultants) who design and implement a system that delivers functionality to meet the requirements
    - Custom software usually has a long lifetime, must be supported over that lifetime
    - Lifetime could be 10 years or more
    - Many systems (legacy systems) are decades old 
- Starting point (Business): a business opportunity, identified by individuals or a company
    - They develop a software product to take advantage of this opportunity and sell this to customers
    - The company who identified the opportunity design and implement a set of software features that realize the opportunity and that will be useful to customers
    - Who is responsible for deciding on the development timescale, what features to include, and when the product should change?
    - The software development company (not an external client!)
    - Rapid delivery of software products is essential to capture the market for that type of product

## What is a Software Product Line?

- A set of software products that share a common core
    - Each member of the product line includes customer-specific adaptations and additions
    - Software product lines may be used to implement a custom system for a customer with specific needs that cannot be met by a generic product
- An example would be a company providing communication software for different emergency services that use different types of radio/communication equipment
- Another example would be software for smart TVs (due to many different models of said televisions)

## What is a Platform?

- A software (or combined software and hardware) product that includes functionality so that new applications can be built on it. 
- Example: Facebook, where you can create "Facebook apps"
- Self-Example: Github?
