## Software Support

- Traditionally, separate teams were respinsible for software development, software
  release, and software support 
- The development team passed over a "final" version of the software to a release 
  team; This team then built a release version, tested this, an prepared release 
  documentation before releasing the software to customers
- A third team was responsible for providing customer support 
    - The original development team were sometimes also responsible for implementing 
      software changes
    - Alternatively, the software may have been maintained by a separate "maintenance 
      team"
