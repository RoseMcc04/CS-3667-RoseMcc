## Software Products

- Three factors that drive the design of software products
    - Business and consumer needs unmet by current products
    - Dissatisfaction with existing software products
    - Changes in technology that make completely new types of products possible
- In the early stage of product development, you are trying to understand <ins>what product features would be useful to users, </ins>and <ins>what they like and dislike about the products that they use</ins>

## Software Features

- A feature is a fragment of functionality such as a "print" feature, a "change background" feature, a "new document" feature, etc
- You should aim to create a list of features to be included in your product **before** you start to code
- The feature list should be your starting point for product design and development

## User Understanding

- It makes sense in any product development to spend time trying to understand the potential users and customers of your product
- A range of techniques have been developed for understanding the ways that people work and use software
    - *Examples: user interviews, surveys, ethnography, and task analysis*
    - Some of these are expensive and unrealistic for small companies
    - We will talk briefly about some of these
- Informal user analysis and discussions - asking users about their work, the software they use, and its strengths and weaknesses - are inexpensive and very valuable
