## Software Products

- Three factors that drive the design of software products
    - Business and consumer needs unmet by current products
    - Dissatisfaction with existing software products
    - Changes in technology that make completely new types of products possible
- In the early stage of product development, you are trying to understand <ins>what product features would be useful to users, </ins>and <ins>what they like and dislike about the products that they use</ins>

## Software Features

- A feature is a fragment of functionality such as a "print" feature, a "change background" feature, a "new document" feature, etc
- You should aim to create a list of features to be included in your product **before** you start to code
- The feature list should be your starting point for product design and development

## User Understanding

- It makes sense in any product development to spend time trying to understand the potential users and customers of your product
- A range of techniques have been developed for understanding the ways that people work and use software
    - *Examples: user interviews, surveys, ethnography, and task analysis*
    - Some of these are expensive and unrealistic for small companies
    - We will talk briefly about some of these
- Informal user analysis and discussions - asking users about their work, the software they use, and its strengths and weaknesses - are inexpensive and very valuable

## Feature Description Template

- **Action**
    - A description of how the input data is processed
    - **Activation**
        - How the feature is activated by the user
    - **Input**
        - The input from the user and other sources
- **Output**
    - The output to the user and the system

## Personas

- You need to have an understanding of your potential users to design features that they are likely to find useful and to design a user interface that is suited to them
- **Personas**
    - "Imagined users" where you create a character portrait of a type of user that might use your product:
        - For instance, if your product is aimed at managing appointments for dentists, you might create a dentist persona, a receptionist persona, and a patient persona
- Personas of different types of user help you imagine what these users may want to do with your software and how it might be used; They help you envisage difficulties that they might have in understanding and using product features 

### Example

- **Jack, a primary school teacher**
    - Jack, age 32, is a primary school (elementary school) teacher in Ullapool, a large coastal village in the Scottish Highlands. He teaches children from ages 9 to 12. He was born in a fishing community north of Ullapool, where his father runs a marine fuels supply business and his mother is a community nurse. He has a degree in English from Glasgow University and retrained as a teacher after several years working as a web content author for a large leisure group.
    - Jack’s experience as a web developer means that he is confident in all aspects of digital technology. He passionately believes that the effective use of digital technologies, blended with face-to-face teaching, can enhance the learning experience for children. He is particularly interested in using the iLearn system for project-based teaching, where students work together across subject areas on a challenging topic.

### Descriptions

- A persona should "paint a picture" of a type of product user; They should be relatively short and easy-to-read
- You should describe their background and why they might want to use your product
- You should also say something about their educational bakground and technical skills
- These help you assess whether or not a software feature is likely to be useful, understandable, and usable by typical product users

### Aspects of Descriptions

| Aspect         | Description                                                                                                                                       |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Personalization | You should give them a name and say something about their personal circumstances. It is sometimes helpful to use an appropriate stock photograph to represent the person in the persona. Some studies suggest that this helps project teams use personas more effectively. |
| Job-related     | If your product is targeted at business, you should say something about their job and (if necessary) what that job involves. For some jobs, such as a teacher where readers are likely to be familiar with the job, this may not be necessary. |
| Education       | You should describe their educational background and their level of technical skills and experience. This is important, especially for interface design. |
| Relevance       | If you can, you should say why they might be interested in using the product and what they might want to do with it. |

### Benefits

- The main benefit of personas is that they help you and other development team members empathize with potential users of the software
- Personas help because they are a tool that allows developers to "step in the user's shoes"
    - Instead of thinking about what you would do in a particular situation, you can imagine how a persona would behave and react
    - Many users of the software you build will not be as technically interested or sophisticate as you, this helps remind you of that!
- Personas can help you check your ideas to make sure that you are not including product featres that are not really needed
- They help you to avoid making unwarranted assumptions, based on your own knowledge, and designing an over-complicated or irrelevant product

### Derivation

- Personas should be uased on an understanding of the potential product users, their jobs, their background, and their aspirations
- You should study and survey potential users to understand what they want and how they might use the product
- From this data, you can then abstract the essential information about the different type of product user and use this as a basis for creating personas
- Personas that are developed on the basis of limited user information are called proto-personas
- **Proto-Persona**
    - created as a collective team exercise using whatever information is available about potential product users; They can bever be as accurate as personas developed from detailed user studies but are better than nothing
