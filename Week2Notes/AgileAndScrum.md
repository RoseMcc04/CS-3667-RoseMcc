## Agile 

- Virtually all software products are now developed using an agile approach

### Agile Software Engineering

- Agile focus: quick delivery of functionality, minimal overhead, reponsiveness to change
- A large number of agile methods have been developed:
    - No best agile method or technique
    - Which to choose? --> Depends on who is using the technique, the development team, and the type of product being developed

### Traditional Plan-Driven Development

- Traditional, plan-driven development evilved to support the engineering of large, long-lifetime systems where teams may be geographically dispersed and work on the software for several years
- Approach based on controlled and rigorous software development processes that include detailed project planning, requirements specification, and analysis and system modelling
- Downside: plan-driven development involves significant overheads and documentation and it does not support the rapid development and delivery of software

### Origin of Agile Methods

- Agile methods were developed in the 1990s to address problems with plan-driven approaches
- Agile methods:
    - Focus on the software rather than its documentation
    - Develop software in a series of increments
    - Aim to reduce process bureaucracy as much as possible
- Common concept: what delivers value to the customer, versus what is "overhead" or "waste" that can be eliminated

### The Agile Manifesto (2001)

- We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others to do it. Through this work, we have come to value: 
    - individuals and interactions over processes and tools
    - working software over comprehensive documentation
    - customer collaboration over contract negotiation
    - responding to change over following a plan
- While there is value on the items on the right, we value the items on the left more 

### Incremental Development

- All agile methods are based around incremental development and delivery
- Product development focuses on the software features, where a feature does something for the software user
- With incremental development, you start by prioritizing the features so that the most important features are implemented first
    - You only define the details of the feature being implemented in an increment
    - That feature is implemented and delivered
- Users or surrogate users can try it out and provide feedback to the development team. You then go on to define and implement the next feature of the system
