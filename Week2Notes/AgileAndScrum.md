## Agile 

- Virtually all software products are now developed using an agile approach

### Agile Software Engineering

- Agile focus: quick delivery of functionality, minimal overhead, reponsiveness to change
- A large number of agile methods have been developed:
    - No best agile method or technique
    - Which to choose? --> Depends on who is using the technique, the development team, and the type of product being developed

### Traditional Plan-Driven Development

- Traditional, plan-driven development evilved to support the engineering of large, long-lifetime systems where teams may be geographically dispersed and work on the software for several years
- Approach based on controlled and rigorous software development processes that include detailed project planning, requirements specification, and analysis and system modelling
- Downside: plan-driven development involves significant overheads and documentation and it does not support the rapid development and delivery of software

### Origin of Agile Methods

- Agile methods were developed in the 1990s to address problems with plan-driven approaches
- Agile methods:
    - Focus on the software rather than its documentation
    - Develop software in a series of increments
    - Aim to reduce process bureaucracy as much as possible
- Common concept: what delivers value to the customer, versus what is "overhead" or "waste" that can be eliminated

### The Agile Manifesto (2001)

- We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others to do it. Through this work, we have come to value: 
    - individuals and interactions over processes and tools
    - working software over comprehensive documentation
    - customer collaboration over contract negotiation
    - responding to change over following a plan
- While there is value on the items on the right, we value the items on the left more 

### Incremental Development

- All agile methods are based around incremental development and delivery
- Product development focuses on the software features, where a feature does something for the software user
- With incremental development, you start by prioritizing the features so that the most important features are implemented first
    - You only define the details of the feature being implemented in an increment
    - That feature is implemented and delivered
- Users or surrogate users can try it out and provide feedback to the development team. You then go on to define and implement the next feature of the system 

#### The Big Picture

- **Product feature list**
  - Choose features to be included in increment
  - Refine feature descriptions
  - Implement and test feature
  - Integrate feature into system
  - Deliver system increment
  - If all features are complete, deliver system release

#### Activities

| **Activity**                         | **Description**                                                                                                               |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Choose features to be included in an Increment | Using the list of features in the planned product, select those features that can be implemented in the next product increment. |
| Refine feature descriptions          | Add detail to the feature descriptions so that the team members have a common understanding of each feature and there is sufficient detail to begin implementation. |
| Implement and test                   | Implement the feature and develop automated tests for that feature that show that its behavior is consistent with its description. |
| Integrate feature and test           | Integrate the developed feature with the existing system and test it to check that it works in conjunction with other features. |
| Deliver system increment             | Deliver the system increment to the customer or product manager for checking and comments. If enough features have been implemented, release a version of the system for customer use. |

### Agile Principles

| **Principle**                       | **Description**                                                                                                                                   |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Involve the customer                | Involve customers closely with the software development team. Their role is to provide and prioritize new system requirements and to evaluate each increment of the system. |
| Embrace change                      | Expect the features of the product and the details of these features to change as the development team and the product manager learn more about the product. Adapt the software to cope with changes as they are made. |
| Develop and deliver incrementally   | Always develop software products in increments. Test and evaluate each increment as it is developed and feed back required changes to the development team. |
| Maintain simplicity                 | Focus on simplicity in both the software being developed and the development process. Wherever possible, do what you can to eliminate complexity from the system. |
| Focus on people, not the development process | Trust the development team and do not expect everyone to always do things in the same way. Team members should be left to develop their own ways of working without being limited by prescriptive software processes. |
